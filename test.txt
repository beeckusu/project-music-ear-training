Chord Training
Guess History
Like the Note guesses, shows the history of selected Chords + whether the guess was correct. Unlike the note guessing, you can only really show icons to see if you were right (checkmark), wrong (X), or partial (~). Hovering over each card representing a round shows you what notes you guessed and which notes you missed.

Mode UI
This is the part that varies per chord mode, but for the Chord Identification mode, there's a few components:
    Timer - if a timer duration is set (>0sec), then a timer is shown.
    Selected chord display - shows the chord name (Ex. C major)
    Feedback text - like in other modes.
    Round buttons - the play again button and next chord in a row (like other modes)
    Submit button - under the above two buttons. The submit button should look different than the other two and is bigger, making it easier to press.

Keyboard
Like the note training keyboard, except when you click a key, it highlights gray. Clicking it again unhighlights it.
When a guess is submitted, keys highlighted a colour when:
    Green - The note is clicked and the note is in the chord
    Yellow - The note is not clicked and the note is in the chord
    Red - The note is clicked but the note is not in the chord
