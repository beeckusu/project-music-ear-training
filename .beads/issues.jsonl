{"id":"meta-y4x","title":"Fix timeout events not updating guess history in chord modes","description":"When the round timer expires in Chord Training or Chord Identification modes, the timeout should count as an incorrect guess and be added to the ChordGuessHistory component. Currently, timeout events advance to the next round but don't update the guess history.\n\nExpected behavior:\n- When round timer reaches 0, add a failed attempt to guessHistory with 0% accuracy\n- Display a ✗ icon in the ChordGuessHistory component\n- Should work for both Chord Training and Chord Identification modes\n\nCurrent behavior:\n- Timeout advances to next round\n- No entry is added to guess history\n- User can't see that a timeout occurred in their history\n\nTechnical notes:\n- GameOrchestrator.handleTimeout() is being called (line 1452)\n- It calls gameState.handleIncorrectGuess() (line 775)\n- But the guess history is not being updated in the UI\n- Console logs in handleIncorrectGuess should help debug if the method is being called\n\nFiles involved:\n- src/game/GameOrchestrator.ts (timeout detection and handling)\n- src/game/SingleChordGameState.tsx (handleIncorrectGuess method)\n- src/game/ChordIdentificationGameState.tsx (handleIncorrectGuess method)\n- src/game/strategies/ChordTrainingStrategy.ts (context.note was added)","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-28T12:21:41.1751366-05:00","updated_at":"2025-12-28T12:21:41.1751366-05:00"}
