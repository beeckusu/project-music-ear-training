  Phase 1: Foundation (Parallel)

  Can be done in any order or simultaneously:
  1. meta-la3.1 - Guess History component
  2. meta-la3.8 - Shared Round Buttons & Timer

  Phase 2a: Chord Training Track

  Sequential:
  3. meta-la3.2 - Gray toggle selection on keyboard
  4. meta-la3.3 - Color feedback after submit (needs .2)
  5. meta-la3.4 - Chord Training UI layout (needs .2, .3, .8)

  Phase 2b: Chord Identification Track (Parallel with 2a)

  Can be done while Phase 2a is in progress:
  6. meta-la3.5 - Read-only keyboard with green highlights
  7. meta-la3.6 - Chord Selection UI (base notes + chord types)
  8. meta-la3.7 - Chord Identification UI layout (needs .5, .6, .8)

  Phase 3: Polish (Sequential)

  After both tracks complete:
  9. meta-la3.9 - Styling and polish (needs .4 and .7)
  10. meta-la3.11 - Accessibility (needs .9)
  11. meta-la3.10 - Comprehensive testing (needs .9)

  Optimal Start Points

  Best starting order:
  1. Start with meta-la3.1 (Guess History) - standalone, useful for both modes
  2. Start with meta-la3.8 (Round Buttons/Timer) - needed by both UI layouts
  3. Then split:
    - Chord Training: .2 → .3 → .4
    - Chord Identification: .5 + .6 → .7

  - meta-la3.8 (Round Buttons/Timer) - Needed by both mode UIs

  Or if you want to dive straight into one mode:
  - Chord Training path: Start with meta-la3.2
  - Chord Identification path: Start with meta-la3.5 or meta-la3.6
