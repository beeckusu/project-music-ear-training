handleStartPractice
    -This can be inlined to emit the start event, but then I want NoteIdentification to be subscribed to the start event with the UI logic

the settings useEffect feels like it should be lifted into the Orchestrator, but maybe this might be too complex for now.

What are we doing with the pause state useEffect at L214? It looks like 225-236 is written as event subs now above. Is there any use for this here?
